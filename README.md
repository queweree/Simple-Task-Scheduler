## ⏰ Notification System

The app features an intelligent notification system:

| Scenario | Notification Trigger |
|----------|---------------------|
| **≤ 24 hours remaining** | Hourly reminders |
| **1 hour remaining** | Urgent "Deadline after 1 hour!" alert |
| **Deadline reached** | "Task is expired" notification |
| **Task completed** | All pending notifications are cancelled |

---

## 🎵 Custom Sound

The notification sound is a custom `.caf` audio file taken from the psychological horror game **"Fear to Fathom"** — adding a unique and eerie vibe to deadline reminders.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Framework:** SwiftUI + UIKit (for notifications)
- **Local Notifications:** `UserNotifications` framework
- **Data Persistence:** `UserDefaults` with `Codable`
- **Timer Mechanism:** `Timer.publisher` with Combine
- **Minimum iOS Version:** 15.0

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-scheduler.git
cd task-scheduler
```

2. Open `task_scheduler.xcodeproj` in Xcode

3. Select your target device/simulator (iOS 15+)

4. Press `Cmd + R` to build and run

---

## 📲 Usage

1. **Add a task:** Tap the `+` button → Enter name → Select date & time → Save
2. **Mark as done:** Tap the circle icon next to a task
3. **Edit a task:** Tap on the task text
4. **Delete a task:** Swipe left on the task row
5. **Grant permissions:** Allow notifications when prompted on first launch

---

## 🔔 Notification Permissions

The app will request notification permissions on first launch. You need to allow notifications for the reminder system to work properly. You can change permissions later in **Settings → Notifications → task_scheduler**

---

## 🧪 Testing Notifications

To test notifications without waiting hours:

1. Add a task with deadline 1-2 minutes from now
2. Close the app (swipe up from app switcher)
3. Wait for the notification to arrive

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Notifications won't appear if the user has disabled them in system settings
- Custom sound file must be in `.caf` format with PCM/IMA4 encoding
- Hourly reminders only work for deadlines within 24 hours
